Functional/code TODO:
    - finish the move of tool_functions. Check that the last moves are working
    - Fix the parameters setting mess: switch to argparse, use a config, something.
    - Make tests!!


Towards making a Python package out of PATENA:
    - Move the bin/external code to a bin dir. Initially it will still be compiled using an install.sh file but all bins should go to a predefined dir with predefined names...no need to set env. variables.
Could add a check to see if the user already has any of these tools installed and in PATH?
    - Same for any other reference files, put them all in a standardized place that python package can reach.
